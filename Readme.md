# ðŸŽ“ Student Performance Report

This project processes an array of student records, each containing a student's name, roll number, and marks in three subjects: **Math**, **Science**, and **English**.

The program performs the following key tasks:

- **Calculates the average marks** for each student and assigns a corresponding **grade** based on their average.
- **Identifies the top performer(s)** in the entire class based on the highest average marks. It also accounts for ties where multiple students have the same top average.
- **Lists students who have failed**, defined as those with an average below 50.
- **Determines subject-wise toppers**, highlighting students who achieved the highest score in each individual subject.

After processing, the program outputs a comprehensive report to the console, summarizing all the above information in a clear and readable format.

This project simulates a simple academic performance evaluation system and demonstrates the use of JavaScript for data manipulation and reporting without any graphical user interface.
